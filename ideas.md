Hybrid genre things
- Top down shooter / defense game. Gardener. Plant things with money, defend them against waves of enemies. Plants grow and you get money back when they survive a round by selling the fruit and veg.

- Breed and combine creatures or items. Combine THINGS. some sort of turn based or automated combat. earn more of those things through the combat, gacha style. Combine your things into different/better things.

- Hybrid car racing. Come first but also be the most energy efficient while driving.
